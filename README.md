# [Rembrandt-s-Genius](https://github.com/indzhov/Rembrandt-s-Genius/blob/master/Untitled.ipynb)
This is my final project for the Data Science course, provided by SoftUni Bulgaria. It is trying to accredit the theory behind the Rembrandt's genius through the scientific way, that we were taught during the course .

This is a Digital Humanities project. This field have not a correct description. However, one of the well-known formulating is : an academic field concerned with the application of computational tools and methods to traditional humanities disciplines such as literature, history, and philosophy. In my case art history.
