# [Rembrandt-s-Genius](https://github.com/indzhov/Rembrandt-s-Genius/blob/master/Untitled.ipynb)
This is my final project for the Data Science course, provided by SoftUni Bulgaria. It is trying to accredit the theory behind the Rembrandt's genius through the scientific way, that we were taught during the course .

This is a Digital Humanities project. This field have not a correct description. However, one of the well-known formulating is : an academic field concerned with the application of computational tools and methods to traditional humanities disciplines such as literature, history, and philosophy. In my case art history.

The following paper will be used as a Data Science project for a practical exam. The course Data Science- July 2020 is hosted by Software University, Bulgaria. 

As a source of our topic will be used the public access to Rijksmuseumâ€™s collection. From it we will form a number of hypothesis, which have been researched. Before every main section there will be a text information like this, with full information about the researched hypothesis, the structure of the code, and at the end will be presented the outcome of the analyze. Every cell will be documented as well. The sections are as follows : 

# 1. Cleaning of the data set (half a million records) :
# 2. EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis) and Data Visualization : 
  - From the whole collection only 15 authors have more than 1000 works.
